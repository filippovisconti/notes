Many types of LANs have existed over the years, but today’s networks use two general
types of LANs: Ethernet LANs and wireless LANs. Ethernet LANs happen to use cables
for the links between nodes, and because many types of cables use copper wires, Ethernet
LANs are often called wired LANs. Ethernet LANs also make use of fiber-optic cabling,
which includes a fiberglass core that devices use to send data using light. In comparison to
Ethernet, wireless LANs do not use wires or cables, instead using radio waves for the links
between nodes; Part V of this book discusses Wireless LANs at length.

# The Variety of Ethernet Physical Layer Standards

The term Ethernet refers to an entire family of standards. Some standards define the specif-
ics of how to send data over a particular type of cabling, and at a particular speed. Other
standards define protocols, or rules, that the Ethernet nodes must follow to be a part of an
Ethernet LAN. All these Ethernet standards come from the IEEE and include the number
802.3 as the beginning part of the standard name.
Ethernet supports a large variety of options for physical Ethernet links given its long history
over the last 40 or so years. Today, Ethernet includes many standards for different kinds of
optical and copper cabling, and for speeds from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) up to 400
gigabits per second (Gbps). The standards also differ as far as the types and length of the
cables.
The most fundamental cabling choice has to do with the materials used inside the cable for
the physical transmission of bits: either copper wires or glass fibers. Devices using UTP
cabling transmit data over electrical circuits via the copper wires inside the cable. Fiber-optic
cabling, the more expensive alternative, allows Ethernet nodes to send light over glass fibers
in the center of the cable. Although more expensive, optical cables typically allow longer
cabling distances between nodes.
To be ready to choose the products to purchase for a new Ethernet LAN, a network engineer
must know the names and features of the different Ethernet standards supported in Ethernet
products. The IEEE defines Ethernet physical layer standards using a couple of naming con-
ventions. The formal name begins with 802.3 followed by some suffix letters. The IEEE also
uses more meaningful shortcut names that identify the speed, as well as a clue about whether
the cabling is UTP (with a suffix that includes T) or fiber (with a suffix that includes X).
Table 2-2 lists a few Ethernet physical layer standards.

So, what is an Ethernet LAN? It is a combination of user devices, LAN switches, and dif-
ferent kinds of cabling. Each link can use different types of cables, at different speeds.
However, they all work together to deliver Ethernet frames from the one device on the LAN
to some other device.

# Building Physical Ethernet LANs with UTP

This section focuses on the three most commonly used Ethernet standards: 10BASE-T
(Ethernet), 100BASE-T (Fast Ethernet, or FE), and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet, or GE).
Specifically, this section looks at the details of sending data in both directions over a UTP
cable. It then examines the specific wiring of the UTP cables used for 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps,
and 1000-Mbps Ethernet.

## Transmitting Data Using Twisted Pairs
While it is true that Ethernet sends data over UTP cables, the physical means to send the
data uses electricity that flows over the wires inside the UTP cable. To better understand
how Ethernet sends data using electricity, break the idea down into two parts: how to create
an electrical circuit and then how to make that electrical signal communicate 1s and 0s.
The twisting helps solve some important physical transmission
issues. When electrical current passes over any wire, it creates electromagnetic interference
(EMI) that interferes with the electrical signals in nearby wires, including the wires in the
same cable. (EMI between wire pairs in the same cable is called crosstalk.) Twisting the wire
pairs together helps cancel out most of the EMI, so most networking physical links that use
copper wires use twisted pairs.

To complete the physical link, the nodes each need an RJ-45 Ethernet port that matches
the RJ-45 connectors on the cable so that the connectors on the ends of the cable can con-
nect to each node. PCs often include this RJ-45 Ethernet port as part of a network interface
card (NIC), which can be an expansion card on the PC or can be built in to the system itself.

## UTP Cabling Pinouts for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T

### Straight-Through Cable Pinout

10BASE-T and 100BASE-T use two pairs of wires in a UTP cable, one for each direction.
For correct transmission over the link, the wires in the UTP cable must be connected to the
correct pin positions in the RJ-45 connectors.
Those two wires must be connected to the correct pins in the RJ-45 connector on the switch
so that the switch’s receiver logic can use the correct wires.
To understand the wiring of the cable—which wires need to be in which pin positions on
both ends of the cable—you need to first understand how the NICs and switches work. As
a rule, Ethernet NIC transmitters use the pair connected to pins 1 and 2; the NIC receivers
use a pair of wires at pin positions 3 and 6. LAN switches, knowing those facts about what
Ethernet NICs do, do the opposite: Their receivers use the wire pair at pins 1 and 2, and their
transmitters use the wire pair at pins 3 and 6.

To allow a PC NIC to communicate with a switch, the UTP cable must also use a straight-
through cable pinout. The term pinout refers to the wiring of which color wire is placed
in each of the eight numbered pin positions in the RJ-45 connector. An Ethernet straight-
through cable connects the wire at pin 1 on one end of the cable to pin 1 at the other end of
the cable; the wire at pin 2 needs to connect to pin 2 on the other end of the cable; pin 3 on
one end connects to pin 3 on the other, and so on.

A straight-through cable works correctly when the nodes use opposite pairs for transmitting
data. However, when two like devices connect to an Ethernet link, they both transmit on
the same pins. In that case, you then need another type of cabling pinout called a crossover
cable. The crossover cable pinout crosses the pair at the transmit pins on each device to the
receive pins on the opposite device.

### Choosing the Right Cable Pinouts

The key is to know whether a device acts like a PC NIC, transmitting at pins 1 and 2, or like a switch, transmitting at pins 3 and 6.
Then, just apply the following logic:
| Type                   | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Crossover cable        | If the endpoints transmit on the same pin pair   |
| Straight-through cable | If the endpoints transmit on different pin pairs |

PC NICs, Routers, Wireless AP transmit on pins 1, 2. Hubs and Switches transmit on pins 3, 6.

> Switches have a feature called auto-mdix that notices when the wrong cable is used and automatically changes its logic to make the link work.

## UTP Cabling Pinouts for 1000BASE-T

UTP Cabling Pinouts for 1000BASE-T
1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) differs from 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T as far as the cabling
and pinouts. First, 1000BASE-T requires four wire pairs. Second, it uses more advanced
electronics that allow both ends to transmit and receive simultaneously on each wire pair.
However, the wiring pinouts for 1000BASE-T work almost identically to the earlier stan-
dards, adding details for the additional two pairs.
The straight-through cable for 1000BASE-T uses the four wire pairs to create four circuits,
but the pins need to match. It uses the same pinouts for two pairs as do the 10BASE-T and
100BASE-T standards, and it adds a pair at pins 4 and 5 and the final pair at pins 7 and 8.

The Gigabit Ethernet crossover cable crosses the same two-wire pairs as the crossover cable
for the other types of Ethernet (the pairs at pins 1,2 and 3,6). It also crosses the two new
pairs as well (the pair at pins 4,5 with the pair at pins 7,8).
